Let us comment on the results of the study.
Robert Parker predicted that the 1986 Bordeaux wine is very good
to sometimes exceptional.
On the other hand, Ashenfelter said
that the 1986 Bordeaux wine is mediocre.
And made the prediction that the 1989 Bordeaux would
be the wine of the century and the 1990 Bordeaux
would be even better.
In wine options, the 1989 Bordeaux wine
sold for more than twice the price of 1986.
And the 1990 Bordeaux wine sold for even higher prices.
Later, Ashenfelter predicted that the 2000 and the 2003
Bordeaux wines would be great.
And in this case, Robert Parker stated
the 2000 is the greatest vintage Bordeaux has ever produced,
in agreement with Ashenfelter.

So what is the analytics edge in this case?
What we have developed is a linear regression model,
a simple but rather powerful model
for predicting quality of wines.
It only used few variables and we
have seen that it predicted wine prices quite well.
In fact, in many cases it outperformed
wine expert's opinions.
And what is impressive, in this first introductory lecture
to linear regression, is that an analytics approach that
uses data to build a model that improves decision making
is effective in a traditionally qualitative problem.
